# alert_stream
A collection of tools for alerting on weather events, starting with a script designed to trigger a Bluesky post. 

Writes to https://bsky.app/profile/alert-stream.bsky.social

This scripts run on the 'base station' backend and triggers Bluesky post when called. The message is defined in a `alert_message.yaml` YAML file. These files are generated by base station software. The message attributes are evolving but here is a starting version:

```yaml
message: 'Another test of the Bluesky communication system...'
created_by: Some backend base station
created_at: 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss'
site_uuid: 1
host: Fictional.wx
host_site_id: 1
host_sensor_id: 1
trigger_type: file
target_channels: bluesky
site_lat: 0
site_long: 0

## Running script

If your alert message files are written to the default `./inbox/` folder, you can call this script from the command line like so:
```bash
    python3 check_alerts.py
```

## Script options

This script supports the following settings:
* `ALERT_CHECK_INTERVAL`: How often to check for new alerts (in minutes). Default is 5.
* `INBOX_ROOT`: Path to the directory where alert messages are stored. Default is `./inbox`.
* `VERBOSE`: Whether to print additional information during execution. Default is False.

These can be set in a `settings.yaml` file or passed as command-line arguments. The scripts will first load the `settings.yaml` file and then override those values with any command line arguments.

### `settings.yaml` file

The script options can be set in a local `settings.yaml` file located at the same level as the Python script. Here's how it looks: 
```yaml
ALERT_CHECK_INTERVAL: 5
INBOX_ROOT: ./inbox/
VERBOSE: false
```  

### Command line options

These attributes can also be specified with command line options. For instance, to set the interval to 1 minute and enable verbose output, you would use:
```bash
    python3 check_alerts.py --interval 1 --verbose
``` 

To see all available command line options, simply run the script without any arguments:
```bash
    python3 check_alerts.py -h
```
