## So, what is in a key? 

A key is a globally unique indentifier (GUID).

If the key does not exist when an object is created, it will default to a generated key. When created, object keys can be set or based on a domain-specific dialect. 

For example, for a weather monitoring system, it may be based on name, numeric ID, lat, long, and other attributes.
